# Create a very basic GitHub Page

- Create a public repo with the name: `your_github_id.github.io`. Example: if my GitHub ID is `franciscovilchezv`, my repo will be called `franciscovilchezv.github.io`.

- Add a file `index.html` to the repo (make sure you include it in the root of the repo. In other words, it must NOT be inside any additional directory/folder)

- Include the information you want in your index.html and save it in the repo.

- Go to the repo and click on "Settings"

- Got to the "Pages" tab.

- Select branch `main` instead of `None`,  and next to it the option `/ (root)`, then save.

- Wait ~1 minute and then your website should be available at `your_github_id.github.io`
